# Bikeshare Program Analysis

## Overview

Using bikeshare data from NYC in 2019, the trends from that data should give insight on how a similar bikeshare program in another city would be successful. We will analize the data and show, using Tableau, how and when peak usage occured.

## Results

More than 75% of customers in August of 2019 were subscribers. This would indicate that the majority of customers lived in NYC and used the bike share daily, or enough to justify a subscription.

Subscribers, especially male subscribers, accounted for a majority of trips. Subscribers peaked on  weekdays, indicating that they used the bikes for commute.  Non-subscribers peaked on the weekend, indicating either tourists or those looking for a fun weekend activity.

Commute seems to be the most popular use of the bikes. Trips more than often ended between 7-9am or 5-7pm during the week. On the weekend, trip stop times were more spread out.

And once again, the highest amount of trips were by males.

Most end locations were in Manhattan, south of Central Park. This area has more businesses than residential, further showing that commute was key.

Most trips were between 1 to 30 minutes. 5 minutes was the most popular amount of time, showing that the bikes were used mostly for quick trips.

This holds true across all genders. Once again, most trips were taken by males.

## Summary

Using the data, we can see that a bikeshare program in another city could be successful if the following criteria are met:
  - A subscriber base can be built using local customers looking for a quick commute
  - Commute times during the week are no more than 30 minutes. Ideally, they would be between 5-10 minutes.
  - If there's a desire for tourism or fun trips, the weekend would help sales (but is not the primary reason since most people used the bikes for commuting)
  - There are plenty of bikes to be rented out since ending locations, while all in mid to lower Manhattan, where varied.

A couple of other visualizations that would help for future analysis would be:
  - While males did dominate the number of trips, comparing that to the gender breakdown for those who commute would be helpful.
  - And while the bikeshare program is successful in NYC, comparing NYC to Des Moines, the proposed city, would also help. If we could see how traffic density, bike friendly roads, commute times, and tourism are different, we could make a better judgement on whether or not to start a bikeshare there.
